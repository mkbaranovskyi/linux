## Install and run

Install on a server and a client:

```
sudo pacman -S openssh
```

Check status: 

```
sudo systemctl status sshd.service
```

It should be disabled by default. 

**Enable** it and **start**:

```
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service
# sudo systemctl stop sshd.service
# sudo systemctl disable sshd.service
```

Then on the client **connect**:

```
sudo ssh max@192.168.1.2	# put the server username and IP
```

## Configuring 

https://youtu.be/xVW1fGRlRkE

For security purposes you can:

1. Forbid log it using passwords at all
2. Forbid the `root` access to your server (and only allow custom users with `sudo` privileges access it)
3. Change the default SSH port from 22

***


### Forbid password log-in

Client: `ssh-keygen`. 

Pass the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the server: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub max



First, enable the desired port in firewall if you use one. Then change the **configs**:

```
sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line `Port 22`, uncomment it and change to the other port, e.g. `Port 5522`. 

Then find, uncomment and change line: `PermitRootLogin no`. You should remain `sudo` access for the dedicated users though (if you don't have any, create and assing them root privileges).

Restart the server:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

Now the client should connect using this specific port:

```
sudo ssh -p 5522 max@192.168.1.2
```

And you can save this config for the client in the `~/.ssh/config` file (create it if doesn't exist). Use this format:

```
Host targaryen
    HostName 192.168.1.10
    User daenerys
    Port 7654
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/targaryen.key

Host tyrell
    HostName 192.168.10.20

Host martell
    HostName 192.168.10.50

Host *ell
    user oberyn

Host * !martell
    LogLevel INFO

Host *
    User root
    Compression yes

```

Then simply run `ssh targaryen` to connect. If you use ambiguous names (e.g. using `*`), then the first match will be executed.

To override some of the options but leave the rest untouched, use:

```
Host dev
    HostName dev.example.com
    User john
    Port 2322
```

Connect as root instead of the default option

```
ssh -o "User=root" dev
```

**NB**: don't disable regular password access (or at least don't restart your established connection) until you provide another way of authentication! Otherwise you may lose your SSH connection to the server permanently (and you'll have to reconfigure it manually)!
