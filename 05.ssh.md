## Install and run

Install on a server and a client:

```
sudo pacman -S openssh
```

Check status: 

```
sudo systemctl status sshd.service
```

It should be disabled by default. 

**Enable** it and **start**:

```
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service

# sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
# sudo systemctl stop sshd.service
# sudo systemctl disable sshd.service
```

Then on the client **connect**:

```
sudo ssh max@192.168.1.2	# put the server username and IP
```

## Configuring

And here about tunneling: https://youtu.be/AtuAdk4MwWw

For security purposes you can:

1. Forbid log it using passwords at all
2. Forbid the `root` access to your server (and only allow custom users with `sudo` privileges access it)
3. Change the default SSH port from 22

***

**NB**: don't disable regular password access (or at least don't restart your established connection) until you provide another way of authentication! Otherwise you may lose your SSH connection to the server permanently (and you'll have to reconfigure it manually)!

**Client**: 

```
# generate keys
ssh-keygen 

# Pass your public key to the server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub max@192.168.1.2
```

**Server**: Change the **ssh configs** (port and password access):

```
sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find, and uncomment the line `Port 22`, change to the other port, e.g. `Port 5522`. Allow the selected port in a firewall if you use one.

Find, uncomment and change line `PermitRootLogin no`. You should keep `sudo` access for the dedicated users though (if you don't have any, create and assing them root privileges).

Find, uncomment and change line `PasswordAuthentication no` (you should have imported SSH keys before).

Restart the server `sudo systemctl restart sshd.service`. Remember that simply restarting a server doesn't drop the already established connections! ```


**Client**: now the client should connect using this specific port `sudo ssh -p 5522 max@192.168.1.2`

And you can save this config for the client in the `~/.ssh/config` file (create it if doesn't exist). Use this format:

```
Host max-pc
    HostName 192.168.1.2
    User max
    Port 5522

Host tyrell
    HostName 192.168.10.20
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/targaryen.key

Host *ell
    user oberyn

Host * !martell
    LogLevel INFO

Host *
    User root
    Compression yes
```

Then simply run `ssh max-pc` to connect. If you use `*` or`?`, then the first match will be executed.

To override some of the options but leave the rest untouched, use `ssh -o "User=guest" max-pc`
